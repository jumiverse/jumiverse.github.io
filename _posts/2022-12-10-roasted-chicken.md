# Roasted Chicken
JuM love it when **the smell of roasted chicken** is filling the air.
It takes about 2 hours to prepare.
Here is how to prepare the treat:

# Ingredients
- Organic chicken from the farm
- Olive oil
- Broth
- Salt
- Pepper
- Chicken spice
- For salad: Carrots, tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, vinegar

# Steps
- Remove all the giblets
- Wash inside and outside and pat dry
- Massage spice into the skin with a little oil
- Season on the outside and on the inside with salt
- Gently grill in oven on 175 degree for 90-110 minutes
- Leave the meat to rest
- Serve with:
  - mixed salad including carrots, tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, vinegar, olive oil, pepper, salt

# Healthy because
Chicken is a great source of protein. If organic and from free range and raised without antibiotics, the meat is a good choice for your body.
Combined with a mixed salad with rainbow veggies, such as carrots, tomatoes, cucumber or bell pepper the meal contains antioxidants, vitamins and fibre.
