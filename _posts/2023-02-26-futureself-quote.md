# Quotes of the day

##  Be your future self now - BENJAMIN P. HARDY


> "**Everyone has a plan until life punches them in the face. 
Whatever punches life gives to you, your past is just a story.**
Whatever story you choose for your past enormously impacts your present and your future. 
When you frame the past negatively, your goals become reactive to and based on your past."


> You will be the same person in five years as you are today except for the people you meet and the books you read.” - Charlie Jones, Business strategist


> **"By proactively changing your inputs of information, experiences, and people, you become aware of what you previously didn’t know.**
> You see what you previously didn’t notice. 
> You seek what you previously didn’t want. 
> You act in ways you previously didn’t behave."


> "..your Future Self is the byproduct of your environment. Being mindful enables your environment to be the result of your conscious choosing. Choose well."


> "..most people don’t spend much time thinking about their Future Self. Caught up in the short-term dopamine of the present, like randomly scrolling through social media, binge eating, or binge spending, seeking short-term rewards creates long-term costs. **When you engage in short-term reward seeking that produces negative long-term consequences, then you’re costing your Future Self.**

> "Everything you do is either a deficit to or an investment in your Future Self."

> **"Do you want your Future Self to be broke and unhealthy, or fit and free?"**

> “To me, ‘busy’ implies that the person is out of control of their life.” —Derek Sivers

> "**Your schedule reflects your priorities. Your schedule reflects what you’re actually committed to.** Most schedules are dominated by urgent battles and lesser goals such as meetings and Zoom calls. Rarely does someone’s schedule reflect and prioritize their Future Self over their current self."

> "**Your time is the clearest indicator of your commitment.** You can’t hide how you spend your time. To improve freedom of money, relationships, and purpose, own your Freedom of Time."

> "**How much ownership are you willing to take of your own time?** The more you say “No” to lesser goals, the stronger your commitment grows to creating the life and outcomes you want."

> "If you’re always working or always available and never fully recovering, then flow, creativity, and high performance are practically impossible."
